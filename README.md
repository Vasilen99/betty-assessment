ðŸ“¸ Endless Carousel App
This project is a responsive, device-friendly endless image carousel built with React, styled using Tailwind CSS, and tested using Jest. It fetches image data from the public Picsum Photos API and implements a seamless, infinite scroll experience.

ðŸš€ Features
Endless Carousel Simulation
The carousel dynamically clones the first and last images in the dataset to ensure a smooth, circular transition effect, giving the appearance of an infinite loop.

Responsive & Scalable Design
Fully optimized for all screen sizesâ€”from mobile to desktopâ€”ensuring a consistent and polished user experience across devices.

API-Driven Content
Images are retrieved from the Picsum Photos API, which provides randomized image assets.

Dynamic Data Fetching
In case we have many images the app is designed to fetch data based on necessity, following the index of the elements and their total amount.

Testing with Jest
Key functionality is covered with unit tests using the Jest testing framework to ensure reliability and maintainability.

Modern Styling with Tailwind CSS
The UI is styled using utility-first classes, enabling fast iteration with consistent design standards.

Option to display the scroll
By enabling the scroll the user could see the transition and the position of the current element for easier tracking.
